# GeoGram
An HPSG-based Formal Grammar of a Core Fragment of Georgian Implemented in TRALE

# Installation
Before you run the grammar, you need to isntall TRALE.
TRALE is a system for parsing, logic programming and constraint resolution  with typed feature structures in a manner roughly consistent with their use in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).

There are several ways to install TRALE depending depending on your machine and availability of a SICStus Prolog:
* [TRALE download page](http://milca.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/A4/Course/trale/) - this is considered as an official page, where you can find the lattes version of TRALE (at the time of writing this, it needs a Sicstus Prolog installation). This is most comprehensive but arguably the least easy way of installing TRALE.
* [Grammix](https://hpsg.hu-berlin.de/Software/Grammix/) - a bootable CD Rom that contains TRALE along with some sample grammars (e.g., it can be run on windows OS via Virtual Machines). This installation can be suitable for teaching.
* [Standalone TRALE](https://hpsg.hu-berlin.de/Software/Trale/) - a version that does not need commercial Sicstus Prolog but does need Linux OS. This version of TRALE was used during the development of GeoGram.

More details about the installation can be found in [this comprehensive instructions](http://utkl.ff.cuni.cz/%7Erosen/public/trale.pdf) by Alexandr Rosen (copy of it is also located in `docs/`).
